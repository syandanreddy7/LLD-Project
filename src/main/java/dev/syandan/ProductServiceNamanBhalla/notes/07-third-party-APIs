**** 1. Changing HTTP Status Codes ****
Changing the response codes for the ResponseEntity. Now by default twe can observe in the
postman we get the Https status code 200 OK upon successful request to the server,

However Spring provides us with the flexibility to change these status codes.
This is done as below in the respective controller class:

ResponseEntity<Product> response = new ResponseEntity(
                                       productService.getSingleProduct(),
                                       HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
return response;

**** 2. Headers in the Request Body ****

**** 3. Jackson Library ****
The dispatcher server makes use of Jackson Library to convert the JSON to JAVA object
and vice versa.
